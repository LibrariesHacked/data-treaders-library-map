## Voyage of the Data Treader: Put your library on the map

GitHub pages site for Library Data Camp 2019.

#### Adding pages

1. Create a new file in the root called newpage.md (or whatever a suitable page name should be - no spaces!).
2. File content is written in markdown, copy an example (e.g. theday.md) for the basic layout. But also see the [Markdown cheatsheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
2. In the data folder, edit the navigation.yml file to include the new page in the navigation section at the top. For example.

```
navigation_pages:
  - links.md
  - theday.md
  - newpage.md
```

3. Commit and push changes. It should take a couple of minutes to update.
