# Voyage of the data treader: put your library on the map

[To sign up to Data Treaders 2 see our Eventbrite page here](https://datatreaders2.eventbrite.co.uk).

Voyage of the Data Treader 2 is a library data camp dedicated to exploring data and open data in libraries through a mix of workshops, discussions, and data playing. Anyone interested in using data to improve library services is welcome.

## Put your library on the map

Have you heard about the Libraries in Wales data project? "CILIP Cymru Wales worked with the National Library of Wales Wikimedian Jason Evans and LibrariesHacked on the creation of visual datasets of libraries in Wales. All of the data sets are openly available and editable" via Wikidata. Wikidata also currently holds details of over 3,000 public libraries in the UK.

Inspired by this we're inviting Jason Evans to show you (and us) how to add and edit your libraries' details on Wikidata as open data and how to use the Wikidata visualisation tools to "put your library on the map"!

## Library Data Camp

We're calling the day a library data camp because it is partly an unconference. It is up to you, on the day, to decide what the sessions should be by proposing library data-related topics you'd like to discuss or learn more about. For example, at the first Voyage of the Data Treader (at Liverpool Central Library on 20 November 2017), we talked about:

- what is open data;
- open data advocacy;
- extracting data and automation;
- developing a data schema;
- how to use an API;
- publishing your first data set...

Do let us know what you'd like to talk about in advance or pitch your idea on the day.

## What would you get out of the event?

By participating in Voyage of the Data Treader 2, you will:

- understand key terms about data;
- learn data manipulation skills;
- create open data about your library service on Wikidata;
- familiarise yourself with Wikidata tools to create data visualisations;
- have shared ideas to use data to demonstrate impact and to help decision-making.
